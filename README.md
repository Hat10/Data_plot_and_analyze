# PuttiPuttiPlott
Plotting and analyzing data. Under construction.

Currently, PuttiPuttiPlott.py has a function to plot graphs and find peaks and valleys. However, the accuracy for finding peaks/valleys is heavily dependent on noice level. This is something I'm experimenting with.
Working on: Menu (low priority), measuring width, FWHM etc. of holes/valleys/peaks that can futher be analyzed with utilities.py

For utilities.py, Mean, max, min, STD, RSD, RMS values are currently aviable. Menu function is under construction. Takes in datafile with or without header, where data is in columns below header.
Working on: data can either be organized in columns or rows. This is low priority
